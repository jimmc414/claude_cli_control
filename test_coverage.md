### Best Practices for Adding Tests
1. **Test real processes** when possible (not just mocks)
2. **Include timeout tests** for every blocking operation
3. **Test error messages** include helpful context
4. **Verify cleanup** happens even on failure
5. **Use real CLI programs** (echo, cat, python) for integration
6. **Record test tapes** for deterministic replay testing
7. **Test mode transitions** (NEW→DISABLED→PROXY)
8. **Validate tape format** with JSON5 schema
9. **Test secret redaction** with known patterns
10. **Verify exit summaries** for tape usage tracking

## Summary

ClaudeControl has solid test coverage (~81%) with particularly strong testing in:
- Core session management with transport abstraction
- Pattern matching accuracy
- Parallel execution
- **Record & replay functionality**
- **Tape storage and matching**
- **Normalization and redaction**

Areas needing improvement:
- Streaming/named pipes
- Complex state machines
- Resource exhaustion
- Tape fallback scenarios
- Cross-platform tape portability

The test suite effectively validates the four core capabilities (Discover, Test, Automate, **Record & Replay**) with a good mix of unit and integration tests, taking ~20 seconds for a full run. The addition of record & replay testing has improved overall coverage and provides deterministic test execution for CI/CD environments.
